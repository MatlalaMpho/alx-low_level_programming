0x03. C - Debugging

1. Based on the main.c file above, create a file named 0-main.c
2. Copy this main file. Comment out (donâ€™t delete it!) the part of the code that is causing the output to go into an infinite loop.
3. Fix the code in 2-largest_number.c so that it correctly prints out the largest of three numbers, no matter the case.
4. Fix the print_remaining_days() function so that the output works correctly for all dates and all leap years.
